  // (see applyReducedMotion). That is the right call for the data - a saved
  // preset must not be rewritten by an OS preference - but on its own it
  // produces the worst possible symptom: Motion smear and Smooth movement read
  // as ON and do nothing, with nothing anywhere saying why.
  //
  // This is the missing half. It says so, in the one place someone goes to
  // find out, and only while the OS is actually asking - the row is always
  // built and shown or hidden by its `visible` predicate, which Obsidian
  // re-evaluates after every control change.
  //
  // Windows is where this bites hardest, which is why it arrived as a bug
  // report from there. Turning off Settings > Accessibility > Visual effects >
  // Animation effects - or choosing "Adjust for best performance" in the old
  // Performance Options dialog, which does the same thing - sets
  // prefers-reduced-motion for every Chromium app on the machine. People do
  // that for speed, years earlier, with no idea it is an accessibility signal
  // that anything will later read.

  // character in one cell - reproducing that on a canvas made the grid far too
  // legible, a lattice of character-sized rectangles that read as a tiling
  // artefact instead of as fire.

  // Smear is on and fills the spring's quad instead - but the serifs were
  // positioned from `active`, the RESTING geometry. So the moment the caret
  // moved, the stem leaned and stretched away while the serifs stayed nailed
  // to where it had been, leaving two horizontal bars floating next to a
  // detached stem. With smear on by default that was the common case, not an
  // edge case. Here they take their centres from the smeared quad's own top
  // and bottom edges, so they travel with the stem.
  //
  // They stay AXIS-ALIGNED while doing it. Shearing a serif with the quad
  // makes it read as a broken glyph, which is what the original comment was
  // rightly worried about - but the answer to that is to keep them level,
  // not to leave them behind.
  //
  // SHAPE. A real I-beam's serifs are brackets: they thin as they approach
  // the stem rather than butting into it at full weight. Each one is a

  // blends against what this canvas has already painted this frame - nothing,
  // it was just cleared - not against the text underneath. Real backdrop
  // blending has to come from CSS.
  //
  // And it has to go on the WRAPPER, not the canvas. The wrapper is
  // position:fixed with a z-index, which makes it a stacking context, and a
  // stacking context confines its descendants' blending to itself: a
  // mix-blend-mode on the canvas inside would blend against the wrapper's own
  // empty background and produce no visible change at all. On the wrapper the
  // blend applies to the whole group against its parent's content - i.e. the
  // editor. (Which also means an `isolation: isolate` anywhere between the
  // wrapper and .app-container would silently turn this feature off. Don't
  // add one, in either file.)
  //
  // Multiply darkens and screen lightens, so which of the two reads as ink on
  // the page depends on what's behind it: multiply on a light theme, screen
  // on a dark one. Picking by theme keeps the cursor legible in both instead
  // of sinking into the background in one of them.
  //
  // Called from the draw dispatch, before the per-style branch, so it runs on
  // every frame regardless of style - including the frames that have to CLEAR

  // or the energy shimmer): a full-surface clear plus a full-surface composite
  // 30-60 times a second, to change a caret-sized region.
  //
  // So each primitive reports the box it painted and the next frame clears
  // exactly the union of what the last one touched. Nothing is predicted in
  // advance, so this cannot drift out of sync with the drawing code - but a
  // primitive that paints WITHOUT calling _markDirty will leave ghost pixels
  // behind. If you add an effect, mark its bounds, generously: over-reporting

  //   hot  — continuous rAF (capped near 60fps on high-refresh displays),
  //          while input is recent or any animation is genuinely in flight
  //   warm — ~30fps, only while a blink fade is mid-transition
  //   idle — a 200 ms heartbeat (or the blink's next fade, if sooner) that
  //          re-checks state and repaints ONLY if the
  //          picture changed; with a static, non-fading cursor the canvas
  //          isn't touched at all, so idle cost approaches zero
  // Input events snap the loops back to hot instantly (the pending idle
  // timeout is cancelled and a frame is requested immediately), so the
  // scheduling can never add perceptible input latency.
  // Called from input events. Timestamps the activity and wakes any dozing
  // loop right now instead of letting it sleep out its timeout.

  // (one tick, a signature that matches, no draw), and it is what lets a

  // =========================================================================
  // Multi-cursor: full effects on secondary carets
  // =========================================================================
  // Every non-primary caret up to SECONDARY_FULL_MAX gets the primary's whole
  // pipeline rather than a 2px line. Nothing in that pipeline takes a caret
  // argument; it reads and writes the fields in CARET_STATE_FIELDS on
  // `this`, and those are accessors over the current caret's state object
  // (this._caret), so _withCaret makes a secondary's bundle current with one
  // pointer, runs the primary's own code, and points back.
  //
  // What is per caret: position, smoothing, the smear spring, the trail,
  // the pending (Move Delay) state, a Signal Glitch burst, and the pop
  // effects a move spawns (letter pop, pixel trail, disintegration, jump
  // trail). What stays global: the blink clock (lastMoveTime - every caret
  // blinks with the primary), Speed Demon's heat, Thunderstrike, Fireworks,
  // Hot-head and Stardust, which follow the primary only.
  // A caret's state is an object (CaretState): the primary's is this._caret,
  // a full-effect secondary's is its bundle in this._secondaries. Every
  // per-caret field (CARET_STATE_FIELDS) is an accessor on the class that
  // forwards to this._caret (the end of plugin.ts), so the pipeline
  // addresses whichever caret is current as `this.x`, and switching carets
  // is one pointer. Until 1.5.8 _withCaret copied the forty fields into a
  // scratch bundle and the secondary's in, ran the code, and copied both
  // back - twice per secondary per frame - and three of the smear's fields
  // were missing from the list, so every secondary's spring integrated the
  // primary's points toward its own target.
  // A bundle in the state a fresh engine has: the reset, run by a scratch
  // engine whose caret is the new object, so the two cannot drift.

  // position. An Alt+click that makes the new caret main is the common case:
